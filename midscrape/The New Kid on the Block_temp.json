  "description": "One of greatest kids books of all time!\n\nAn interactive animated poetry storybook with hilarious poems you bring to life - for children and adults too!\n\n\u2022 Time named The New Kid on the Block as one of the greatest 100 children's books ever!\n\u2022 Winner of a MOM'S CHOICE Gold Award\n\u2022 Winner of a PARENTS\u2019 CHOICE Gold Honor Award\n\u2022 Winner of the EDITOR'S CHOICE AWARD from Children's Technology Review\n\u2022 An interactive animated storybook of poems originally published by the award-winning Living Books \n\nWith The New Kid on the Block, a very unique interactive poetry book, children are encouraged to learn the meaning of words by exploring poems.  They'll meet an ugly dog, a leaking baby and the exploding Bloders.  They giggle at the antics of a chorus line of 40 dancing bananas and laugh as fearless Tillie eats her fiery chilli. And much more!\n\nIn this irresistible collection of 18 hilarious poems, Jack Prelutsky displays an unerring instinct for subjects that appeal to children (of all ages).  In this collection are poems touched by magic and brought to life with characters that talk and move and sing and dance.  Wonderful worlds, begging to be explored open up at each turn of the page.  With sound effects, music, humor and lots of animations, it's a whole new learning experience.\n\nReading skills grow through word recognition.  Words, phrases and lines can be highlighted individually; they are then read aloud, and animations convey their meaning.\n \nKEY FEATURES: \n\u2022 Eighteen poems, with 59 fully animated pages\n\u2022 Virtually every word on each page comes to life when tapped \n\u2022 Words, phrases and lines can be highlighted individually; they are then read aloud, and animations convey their meaning\n\u2022 Words are \"active\" for extended word play and language learning - tap on any word to hear it spoken \n\u2022 Move between pages with swipe or with scrolling page navigation \n\u2022 Two modes: \"Read to Me\" and the fully interactive \"Let Me Play\" \n\u2022 Multiple settings to further customize the App for your child's reading experience \n\u2022 Parental tips to help you get the most out of this Wanderful interactive storybook \n\nFOR TEACHERS\n\n\u2022 A 31 page overview of the Classroom Activities and a free preview of The New Kid on the Block Classroom Activities guide PDF documents are included.\n\u2022 The full 45 page New Kid on the Block Classroom Activities guide PDF document is available as an in-app purchase. The Classroom Activities for The New Kid on the Block have been created to help develop connections between this interactive storybook and the ongoing activities in your classroom. You will find there the activity plans, reproducibles, extensions, a thematic unit, annotated bibliography, and additional teaching resources, as well as technical, practical, and curricular support. In addition, the activities align strongly with the Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts and Mathematics.\n\nJack Prelutsky has been delighting children for years with his poems, and while Jack has published over 1,000 poems in about 70 volumes, some of his most loved verses are to be found in The New Kid on the Block and he himself has read four of the selections in this App.  Since the publication of The New Kid, Jack's imagination has delved into the realm of dragons, scrambled animals, outer space, and even an \"ordinary\" day at school.\n \nPrivacy Disclosure \nWanderful creates engaging interactive storybooks for children that are educational, fun, and above all safe and appropriate.  This app: \n\u2022 does not collect any information \n\u2022 does not contain ads \n\u2022 contains in-app purchases and does allow you to purchase other Wanderful storybooks\n\u2022 has active links to websites or social network from pages targeted at parents  \n\u2022 uses analytics to improve our app experience but only in aggregate and never with personally identifiable data",
