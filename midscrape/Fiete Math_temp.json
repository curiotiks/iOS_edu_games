  "description": "The math game Fiete Math makes counting easy for kids to understand. Based on the educational approach of Montessori, numbers are touchable objects that your child can group, combine and cut up. \nIn this math app children can discover the links between amounts and numbers and develop their confidence in dealing with them. This makes maths fun for kids.\n\nGAME PREMISE\n\nIn this math game the tasks take the form of wonderful harbor scenarios from all around the world. Incoming ships must be loaded by your kids. Boxes can be grouped together and separated just like building blocks. This will change the cargo number. Kids can play in new countries and harbors, win medals and unlock larger ships. This visible progression means more motivation to keep on playing.\n\nTHE BACKGROUND OF THIS APP - AN UNDERESTIMATED PROBLEM\n\nSeparating and combining numbers are important foundations to develop calculation strategies. Even an intense study of number systems and mathematic strategies during a normal school day is often not enough. Students who need more time can easily fall behind. Any problems in math are often left to be dealt with by an after-school tutor.\n\nOUR SOLUTION - AN APP WITH AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH\n\nIf your child doesn't understand the basics of numbers, repeatedly trying to solve mathematical problems will not help. This app uses a different approach.\n\nChildren learn through new, fun experiences. With this app, your child will experience and learn about the links between amounts and numbers through their own experimentation.\n\nCHILDREN IMPROVE\n\n\u2022 Fiete Math develops understanding of the number system, makes 5 and 10 structures usable and shows calculation methods.\n\u2022 The app lets your child play with numbers like building blocks. Abstract numbers are made into objects.\n\u2022 There are no time limits. Your child can complete the tasks at his or her own speed and gather important knowledge.\n\nThis App is not just a digital copy of a maths book. It innovatively uses the opportunities offered by touchscreen devices to make number systems more understandable.\n\nTo maintain your child\u2019s motivation, we\u2019ve made sure that this math app is fun like any other game. Best case scenario: your child won\u2019t want to put Fiete Math down. Try that with a math textbook ;-)\n\nCONTENTS\n\n1. 1,2,3,...\nCounting, recognising groups\n\n2. SPLITTING NUMBERS\nDividing numbers in different ways, getting to know numbers up to 20\n\n3. THE MAGIC 5\nEasy calculations with 5s, progression to 10s, introduction to the decimal system\n\n4. MATH STRATEGIES\nDoubling and halving, swapping, neighbor tasks, changes in the same or the opposite direction\n\n5. PLUS\nPerfect packages, tasks from easy to hard, inverted tasks\n\n6. MINUS\nPerfect packages, tasks from easy to hard, inverted tasks\n\n7. PRACTISING\nPractice adding and subtracting\n\nThe app includes over 1,000 consecutive tasks using numbers up to 30. Once these are complete, the app randomly creates tasks from the relevant topic so the fun can go on for longer.\n\nFEEDBACK PLEASE\n\nTo develop this app, we carried out intensive research with education specialists and looked at very different teaching methods. We looked into the Montessori method, compared lesson plans, and delved into math books and textbooks by various publishers. We read teachers' manuals and spoke with educators, teachers and tutors. The most important thing is real feedback. We want to continue improving this app. Write to us with your experiences and ideas for Fiete Math: support@ahoiii.com\n\nVisit Fiete online at: www.ahoiii.com\nBeautiful Fiete products are available in our shop: www.shop.ahoiii.com\nBecome a fan!
