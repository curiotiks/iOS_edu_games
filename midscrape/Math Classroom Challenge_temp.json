  "description": "The new Math Classroom Challenge 4 is here! With a ton of new features and improvements, the game has been rescaled in graphical quality, sound, and with the addition of many new features, such as the drone or horizontal operations.\n\nLearning math can be tough sometimes. Math Classroom Challenge is a version of an educational 3D game designed to help young and old alike enjoy solving a variety of mathematical exercises. The game allows you to generate different problems, such as additions and subtractions and others, which must be solved. A water hose is used to select the numbers and solutions.\n\nThere are two types of panels: static panels require searching for numbers on stage, with the help of Benny the puppy. Dynamic panels appear some seconds with three possible solutions. At the end the game shows the results in a final screen.\n\nThis new version 4 has been completely reprogrammed and two new scenarios have been added, one where the player can play in the beach with the sea, and another in space, where the player can also collect rocks to obtain Helium for the fusion reactors on Earth.\n\nAdapted and designed for all ages with simple music and elements that are compatible with kids. In fact, they can enjoy the game just watching Benny, or learn the numbers while flying. The new spatial rocket makes solving math even more attractive for kids. Enjoy playing, and enjoy math.\n\nAnother new features is the drone, that you can play in first and third view, and let you fly around the areas with total freedom. And don't forget that now you can use the water to collect the numbers, but also the magic wand, if you want a more direct experience. Or both at the same time! \n\nEnjoy math in a 3D and safe environment for your family, children, parents, and grandparents. Thank you!",
