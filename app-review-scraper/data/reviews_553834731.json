Since there’s no recharge, I’ll always wait until 5 hearts are restored before starting a race so I’m playing much less than before which I guess is good.",

It felt more relaxing and really suited the game. I’ve noticed I’m not the only one who feels this way, many players seem to prefer the old tune. It’s a bit disappointing to see that some people are even uninstalling the game because of it. I really hope the developers consider bringing back the old song.

The last straw was when I had spent enough money to move on to another race group. There was all ready a winner at that level, so there was no incentive to play. I love a challenge, but I am no longer ready to spend and spend money to win, so I am no longer winning. It is no longer a game of skill, but a game to loose.

Makes doing the events harder also so the game try’s to get you to spend real money. Also had like two days with visibility to watch ads for extra moves, but that has disappeared, which also makes incredibly hard to play. Despite my phone, the app being constantly upgraded the game, also freezes, sometimes especially when I’m trying to do the events or if you pass the levels without losing you get the gold bars.. it’s a fun game, but between the freezing no ads to watch to help you advance or get anything and again the fact that the extra moves are always massive when you don’t have the gold bars but when you do it, it’s always very little is incredibly frustrating",

    "text": "Ok so I had this game a long time ago and it was perfect, it was really great. But now I have downloaded it on my new device and it’s literally changed everything to be like royal match. Some people say royal match copied candy crush, but that is wrong. Even though candy crush came out earlier than royal match, it completely changed the gameplay to be exactly like royal match. But Royal match is waaaaaaaaaaaaay better, I suggest you download Royal Match instead of candy crush. I would have recommended it if they stayed with the old gameplay. One more thing, the levels in the beginning for 1 to 100 are soooooooooooo easy, so fix that. Sorry candy crush but royal match is much better especially after you copied them.",

I stopped playing for awhile and removed the apps when I had to clear space for an iPhone update. When I reinstalled, none of my scores or progress was saved, and I couldn’t sign in using Facebook, so none of my friends are showing up, either. I play games to ease my mind during a stressful day, not to spend a ridiculous amount of money. These games are no longer fun. At least when I play poker, I break even or win.

I quit because the game ceased to be fun and became a job where I was working for King games and getting little reward, while its creators could not satisfy their greed. I’m now about to quit again. Suddenly, there’s not enough boosters to win levels where moves have been reduced by half and puzzles are so sluggish, there’s little hope of defeating them. After completing close to 1000 levels, all of a sudden, it takes 30 attempts and 100 ads to defeat a single puzzle? I will not buy boosters. I never have and watching ads, which are the worst possible and many just scams, is too boring. Enough. Good luck. This is not the only game.",

    "text": "I’ve had this app for around two days and I’m almost to level 50, and I plan to be by level 100 by Friday, that’s how amazing this game is it compares to no other limited switch game, i would usually crash out but not with candy crush I honestly think this is some of the best games I’ve ever played it’s making me consider deleting all my other games because that’s how good it is and not to mention the ASMR is breathtaking I play it in the middle of the night just to hear the ASMR because it’s one of the best especially when the jelly melts and when the hard candy cracks I live for that also the power ups it’s breaks so much which means more ASMR and more wins do you know how fun that is just when you think your not gonna pass the level, you pass it and that’s the great part  because it gives you hope and wants you to play another round I have never in my 14 years of living have found a mobile game as fun as candy crush I hesitated if I should download it because I thought it was an old persons app but if that’s true I’ll gladly be an old person and I’ll be playing this game until I reach the end and you know why because that’s how much I love Candy Crush, generations of my family will play candy crush and you might think I’m just trolling but honestly not because that’s how great this game is and the only complaint I do have is that I can’t change my profile picture that’s the only thing but other than that, this game will be apart of my daily routine for years and that’s a promise I could go on and on but I think I’ll stop here maybe this review will convince you to download this masterpiece because if not what are you doing? Anyways have a good day strangers and feel free to add me my user is Skullguts my profile is a pirate 💗\n\n Sincerely-Yadira",

    "text": "I would love to report an issue it’s very painful just when you are left with just a move to complete a stage and after watching an add then the game just freeze and you are left with lost hope but to Completely close the game and start all over again I don’t know if it’s intentionally or not whatever the case is please help fix this once and for all It’s very painful. I would like to add a recommendation for your team can you create a moves bank on the app to save all unused moves after finishing a stage so that one can easily access the unused moves in times of need. Bless you All.. I’m A Big Fun ✌🏾",

    "text": "Candy Crush use to be an addicting and fun game to play. However, it's 100% rigged to force you to buy lives, gold bars to keep moving ahead with moves or bombs. When you get gold bars as a reward for completing a certain number of levels, it'll make it nearly impossible for you to beat the stage being forced to use the gold bars rewarded until you have no more then the game freezes and you lose super bomb you were rewarded for completing 4 very hard levels. Sadly I'm deleting the app and realized how foolish I was for wasting 100's of hours on this rigged game.",
