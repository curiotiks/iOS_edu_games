Thanks Wanderful!\u201d\n\n- Marc Brown, Author of the Arthur series of books\n\n\"When Arthur attends his first day of school, he learns that Mr. Ratburn, his teacher, has a legendary reputation among the kids as being a very hard teacher. Arthur is dismayed because he has homework on the very first day. It just doesn't seem fair. And to make first-day matters worse, the principal shows off a big trophy as a reminder of the upcoming spell-a-thon. The very next day Mr. Ratburn announces to his class that there will be a spelling test on Friday and the winners will represent the class in the spell-a-thon. And, as Arthur has taught us for so many years, hard work and determination pay off. \n\nThis well-paced book formatted app is enhanced with just the right dose of touch-activated short animations. The narration, available in either Spanish or English, plays automatically and can be adjusted in the Settings so that the narration completes before any of the animations can be played. \"\n\n- Kristin Harris   \u00a92013 Parents' Choice\n\nHave you ever wished you could play inside a story and really interact with all the characters and words?
