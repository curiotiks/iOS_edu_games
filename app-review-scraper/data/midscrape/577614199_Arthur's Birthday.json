  "description": "\u2022 Winner of a MOM'S CHOICE Gold Award\n\u2022 Winner of a PARENTS\u2019 CHOICE Gold Honor Award\n\u2022 PBS-favorite Arthur  stars in this interactive story originally published by Living Books\n\u2022 A fun tale for children about resolving conflicts and choosing between friends\n\nReviews:\n\n\"I am excited to see these engaging interactive versions of my books available to kids everywhere once again. Thanks Wanderful!\u201d\n\n- Marc Brown, Author of the Arthur series of books\n\n\"Arthur's Birthday is an interactive storybook, adapted from the original Living Books software series. It is priced at $4.99 and is one of the best ways you can spend 5 bucks for your child.\n\nThe app includes the original story, which you can have read to you, or which you can explore via extensive interactivity. Nearly every object on every page is interactive in some way, and each reacts to touch in a thoughtfully-designed manner. These elements come alive, interact with other on-screen elements, and interact with the story itself in a logical and appropriate way.\n\nWords are interactive, too. Readers can touch any word to hear what it sounds like. Aside from the obvious reading and word learning that can occur, we also had fun pressing different words to create completely different sentences than those actually written on the screen. And then laugh hysterically at the fun we were having.\n\nAlso included are both English and Spanish versions, parental tips, and rich teacher resources for use in the classroom setting. This is another world-class interactive storybook from Wanderful.\"\n\n- Tim Leverett   \u00a92013 Parents' Choice \n\nArthur\u2019s Birthday is an enchanting interactive reading experience with fully animated content featuring Arthur, star of the longest running children\u2019s animated show in history. Wanderful brings every page of this heart-warming Marc Brown story to life. Arthur and Muffy are each planning their birthday parties for next Saturday afternoon. How will their friends decide which to attend?\n\nRead and play inside each of the fully animated pages, where everything comes to life for hours of delightful story fun as Arthur creates a solution that includes everyone. In English and Spanish with French story content available as an in-app upgrade.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\u2022 Story is in both English and Spanish - change language from any page\n\u2022 Unlock French story content with in-app upgrade\n\u2022 Each page is fully animated and interactive and virtually every item comes to life when tapped\n\u2022 All words are recorded twice and are fully \u201cactive\u201d for extended word play and language learning\n\u2022 A hidden surprise is on each page \u2013 see if you can find all the confetti\n\u2022 Move between pages with swipe or with scrolling page navigation\n\u2022 Two story modes: \u201cRead to Me\u201d and the fully interactive \u201cLet Me Play\u201d\n\u2022 Multiple settings further customize the App for your child\u2019s reading experience\n\u2022 Parental tips help you get the most out of this Wanderful interactive storybook\n\u2022 Teacher resources include a 36 page overview of Wanderful interactive storybooks Classroom Activities and a free preview of the Arthur\u2019s Birthday Classroom Activities guide\n\u2022 The full 61 page Arthur\u2019s Birthday Classroom Activities guide is available as an in-app upgrade\n\nArthur\u2019s Birthday is written by Marc Brown. Over 65 Million Arthur books are in print and the Arthur TV show is the longest running children\u2019s animated show in history.\n\nPrivacy Disclosure\nWanderful creates engaging interactive storybooks for children that are educational, fun, and above all safe and appropriate.
