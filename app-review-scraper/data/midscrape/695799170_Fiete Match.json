In this memo game, Fiete picks up the cards and shows different reactions just like a real player - depending on whether he wins or loses.

The memo game in the lighthouse is thus guaranteed to make you laugh :)\n\nThis memo game is hand-drawn and can be played at various levels of difficulty. You can set the number of memo cards and also how well Fiete should play.
