  "description": "Kahoot! Numbers by DragonBox is an award-winning learning game that gives your child a perfect introduction to math and the foundation they need for future math learning.\n\n\u201cKahoot! Numbers by DragonBox is the first thing you should download on a tablet if you have kids 4-8 years old\u201d -Forbes\n\nThe prestigious Parents magazine names Kahoot! Numbers by DragonBox a best learning app for kids for two years in a row, 2020 and 2021.\n\n\n**REQUIRES A SUBSCRIPTION**\n\nAccess to the contents and functionality of this app requires a subscription to Kahoot! Kids.\n\nThe Kahoot! Kids subscription gives your family access to premium Kahoot! features and 7 award-winning learning apps for math and reading.\n\n\nHOW THE GAME WORKS\n\nKahoot! Numbers by DragonBox goes beyond teaching children to count by teaching your child what numbers are, how they work, and what you can do with them. The game makes it easy and fun for your child to develop their number sense and gain an intuitive understanding of numbers.\n\nKahoot! Numbers by DragonBox brings math to life by turning numbers into colorful and relatable characters, called Nooms. The Nooms can be stacked, sliced, combined, sorted, compared and played with, any way your child pleases. By doing this they will learn basic math and learn addition and subtraction with numbers between 1 and 20.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe app contains 4 different activities for your child to explore, each designed to challenge your child to use the Nooms and basic math in a different way.\n\n\nThe \"Sandbox\" section of the game is designed to let your child explore and experiment with the Nooms. It's also the perfect tool for parents and teachers to explain basic math concepts to kids.\n\n\nIn the \"Puzzle\" section, your child will use basic math to create their own puzzle pieces, and place them in the right spot to reveal a hidden picture. Every move your child makes reinforces number sense. Your child will perform thousands of operations while solving the 250 puzzles.\n\n\nIn the \"Ladder\" section, your child will have to think strategically to build larger numbers. Your child will develop an intuitive understanding of how larger numbers relate to small numbers, and practice basic math strategies every step of the way.\n\n\nIn the \"Run\" section, your child will have to direct the Noom down a path using quick mental calculations. Your child can use their fingers, Nooms, or numerals to jump over obstacles. This activity reinforces your child's number sense and trains their ability to quickly recognize and add numbers.\n\n\nKahoot! Numbers by DragonBox is based on the same pedagogical principles as the other games in the award-winning DragonBox series and works by integrating the learning seamlessly into the gameplay, with no quizzes or mindless repetitions. Every interaction in Kahoot! Numbers by DragonBox is designed to heighten your child\u2019s understanding of numbers and strengthen his or her love of math, giving your child a great foundation for future math learning.\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://kahoot.com/terms-and-conditions/\nPrivacy Policy  https://kahoot.com/privacy-policy/",
