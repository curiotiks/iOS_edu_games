  "description": "The game Fiete Puzzle lets children discover cute animated animals in beautiful picture book landscapes. Impressive camera tracking shots turn this puzzle into something special. The intuitive controls and large puzzle pieces are ideal for infants.\n\nIn the puzzle app, the children visit farm and zoo animals with their hero Fiete and discover fire brigade vehicles, building site vehicles and the hustle and bustle of the port, shop for groceries with Fiete in the supermarket, have a\u00a0birthday party, relax at the campfire, and put Fiete and his friends to bed at the end of the day.\n\nInfants, nursery children and preschoolers will not get enough of the lovingly illustrated puzzles. Inspired by classical lift-out puzzles, the educational game Fiete Puzzle is very easy to play.\n\nThe puzzle game playfully develops language skills, visual perception, and the ability to recognise shapes.\n\nGAME PREMISE\n\n- Each puzzle is a big, beautiful picture book scene. \n- Impressive camera tracking shots literally draw children into the scenery of each puzzle game. \n- At each camera stop, there are missing puzzle pieces in the picture.\n- Puzzle pieces are displayed to the children in the upper right-hand corner of the playing field. The children must find out where the puzzle part fits in and shift it to the right place in the game with their fingers.\n- The final puzzle part is not just any puzzle part, but a very special one - its Sailor Fiete himself. \n- After the children have inserted the puzzle part into the right place with Fiete, the puzzle is finished and the children are rewarded with an animation.\n- After each puzzle game, the children can move through the puzzle and observe their complete work, before moving on to the next animated puzzle game. This is where the parents and children have time to think up little stories about the respective puzzle motif.\n\nCONTENTS\n\n- 9 puzzles with beautiful motifs and exciting themes from the children\u00b4s world.\nNo advertising for third-party products\n\nPUZZLE MOTIFS\n\nFarm\nZoo\nFire Brigade\nSupermarket\nBirthday\nBuilding site\nPort\nCampfire\nGood night\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nBeautifully illustrated images\nEasy to use\nFun with learning\nGorgeous animations\nGreat sound effects\nClear, direct feedback system  \n\nCHILDREN IMPROVE\n\nLogical thinking\nAttention\nConcentration\nMedia literacy\nVisual perception\nEye-hand coordination\nLanguage development\nShape recognition\nCognitive skills\n\nTO PARENTS\n\nDear mums and dads, we ourselves are parents, and only make apps that we would not hesitate to play with our own children.
