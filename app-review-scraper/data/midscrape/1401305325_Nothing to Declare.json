  "description": "On the 50th Anniversary of the EU Customs Union, the Malta Customs Administration proudly presents \u2018Nothing to Declare\u2019 video game to help you understand and appreciate the daily work carried out by the EU Customs Administrations to promote legitimate trade while protecting EU citizens.\n\nThe game takes place in 3 locations, the Airport, the Freeport, and the Post Sorting Facility. You play as a new recruit in the Customs team mentored by Reggie, your boss. \n\nShared international intelligence will help you identify and interrogate suspicious inbound passengers. Your job is to stop and interrogate passengers whose appearance matches those mentioned in the daily intel report, who exit the airport through the wrong doors, carrying pets, or who act suspiciously during interrogation. Take your time with each passenger, there is no room for mistakes!\n\nWork at the Port never ends. A continuous stream of trucks flows through the state of art fixed deep X-Ray head. Time is of the essence so make sure to compare the bill of lading document details like container identifiers, supplier names, and the list of declared goods with the items you see in the container. You\u2019ll be surprised by what some shippers have in store for you!\n\nAn ever-increasing number of packets are shipped to the island every year. Sniffer dogs to the rescue. You have to inspect all suspicious packages - those singled out by the sniffer dogs, coming from outside of the EU, or with a particularly low declaration value.\n\nDon\u2019t worry if this feels too overwhelming, Reggie and European-wide intelligence will help you along the way.",
