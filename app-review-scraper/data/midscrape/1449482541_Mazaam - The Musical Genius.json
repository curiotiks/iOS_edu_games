  "description": "Mazaam - The Musical Genius is an edutainment app that uses classical music as an educational tool and contributes to the global development of children ages 4 to 6. Mazaam immerses children in a world populated by funny animals. The challenge? Reunite sea lion families, feed eagles or help boisterous squirrels get to bed\u2026 While listening to classical music!\n\nTHE MAZAAM UNIVERSE OFFERS:\n\n- 5 MUSICAL CONCEPTS (Pitch, Tempo, Intensity, Timbre and Harmony)\n- 15 educational games : 15-30 minute playtime per game\n-  140+ high quality classical music recordings\n-  No advertising and uncontrolled purchases\n\u2013 Tested by children and approved by parents and teachers\n\u2013 No Internet connection required\n \nWhile playing, children visit five playful worlds and discover masterpieces of classical music.

Children must differentiate between slow and fast musical excerpts. By playing with chameleons, they learn to distinguish tempo.\n \n3 \u2013 World of Lynx (Intensity)\nChildren have fun discovering the different degrees of intensity of sounds: soft or loud. As the lynx know, the contrast between these different intensities forms musical nuances.\n \n4 \u2013 World of Eagles (Timbre)\nTimbre is the \u201ccolour\u201d of sound, the way each sound is produced. For example, it lets us distinguish a flute from a violin. Hungry eagles help children become familiar with wind instruments and string instruments.\n \n5 \u2013 World of Sea Lions (Harmony)\nMusical harmony contains different elements, including consonance and dissonance. Children learn to distinguish between more harmonious or more discordant excerpts with the help of likeable sea lions.\n\n\nAWARDS AND RECOGNITION\n-Best Music app for kids 2020- Educational App Store\n-Best Learning Apps for Kids 2020, PARENTS Magazine\n-Parent and Teacher Choice Award 2020\nChildren\u2019s Technology Review, Rating of 86%\n \n \nTHE SCIENCE BEHIND MAZAAM\n \nIts scientific approach pedagogical method are based on several years of research led by the Canada Research Chair in Music and Learning.\n \nMazaam offers an intuitive and progressive framework.
