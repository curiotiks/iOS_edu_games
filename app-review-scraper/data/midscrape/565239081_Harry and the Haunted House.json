  "description": "\u2022 Winner of a MOM'S CHOICE Gold Award\n\u2022 Winner of a PARENTS\u2019 CHOICE Silver Honor Award\n\u2022 Winner of the Editor's Choice Award from Children's Technology Review\n\u2022 An interactive animated storybook by the creator of the award-winning Living Books\n\u2022 A \u201cspooky\u201d tale of how imagination can make things seem scarier than they are\n\nReviews:\n\"This is one of the best designed interactive children's books I've ever seen\" \n\n- Mac Observer\n\n\"Harry and the Haunted House is a twelve page interactive storybook that blends a well-told story written by Mark Schlichting with thoughtful animation by developer Wanderful. The app offers Read to Me or Let Me Play modes. The former is especially delightful. Animations play automatically, which encourages children to listen up, watch, and take a break from tapping their screen. The story's words are highlighted as expressive voice actors read them so that early readers can follow along.\n\nThough in a sense a ghost story, Harry and the Haunted House will inspire more giggles than scares. After Harry hits his baseball a little too far, he and his friends decide to look for it in the abandoned house where it lands. Children will enjoy seeing how Harry and his friends' imaginations create spooky situations. They see ghosts that turn out to be their own reflection, for example, and hear strange noises that are actually Harry's dog playing with the found ball. In the end, children learn that scary things (like old houses, dark closets, or the space under a bed) are not so terrible once one learns more about them.\"\n\n- Parents' Choice   \u00a92013 Parents' Choice \n\nHave you ever wished you could play inside a story and really interact with all the characters and words? Now you can! Harry and the Haunted House is an imaginative, interactive and slightly spooky reading experience with fully animated content loved by children, parents and teachers alike. \n\nWanderful brings every page of this Mark Schlichting story to life. Read and play along with Harry and his friends as they retrieve their baseball lost in the \u201chaunted\u201d house across the field. \u201cW-W-What\u2019s that noise?\u201d \u201cWe froze in our steps\u2026\u201d\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\u2022 Story is in both English and Spanish - change language from any page\n\u2022 12 fully animated pages  \n\u2022 French story content unlocks with upgrade\n\u2022 Virtually every item on each page comes to life when tapped\n\u2022 All words are \u201cactive\u201d for extended word play and language learning\n\u2022 Animated surprises on each page \u2013 can you find all the performing bugs?\n\u2022 Move between pages with swipe or with scrolling page navigation\n\u2022 Multiple settings to customize the App for your child\u2019s reading experience\n\u2022 Two modes: \u201cRead to Me\u201d and the fully interactive \u201cLet Me Play\u201d\n\u2022 Parental tips to help you get the most out of this Wanderful interactive storybook\n\u2022 Teacher resources include a 31 page overview of Wanderful interactive storybooks Classroom Activities and a free preview of the Harry and the Haunted House Classroom Activities guide \n\u2022 The full 58 page Classroom Activities guide is available as an upgrade\n\nWanderful\u2019s goal is to bring outstanding interactive storybooks to a new generation of children. We hope Harry and the Haunted House provides your family, children and students with hours of delightful story play. \n\nHarry and the Haunted House is written by Mark Schlichting, creator of the Living Books series.\n\nPrivacy Disclosure\nWanderful creates engaging interactive storybooks for children that are educational, fun, and above all safe and appropriate.
