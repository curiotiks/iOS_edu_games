Putt-Putt\u00ae and Rover must work together to rebuild a rocket, and accomplish a few good deeds for the Moon People before they meet the Man in the Moon and are homeward bound. Putt-Putt\u00ae Goes to the Moon teaches the benefit of cooperation and the lasting value of friendship. \n\nPutt-Putt\u00ae Goes to the Moon is an adventure game designed especially for children. Bursting with state-of-the-art animation, dazzling sound, hundreds of Click Points, and fully talking characters to thrill you and your child, Putt-Putt's\u00ae world unfolds around your child's actions - enhancing problem-solving skills and teaching valuable lessons along the way. Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon is like no other game for children or adults! \n\n\u2014User Reviews\u2014 \n\u201cThere are also a couple hidden fun games such as Bear Stormin' -- fly a biplane as a bear and pop balloons and fly through barns -- for kids to play as they explore the moon. Overall, this game is really well done and is a worthwhile purchase which will keep the kids busy for hours.\u201d \n\nFEATURES:\n\u2022 Cosmic Cooperation: Kids learn the value of cooperation as they help Putt-Putt\u00ae and his stranded pal, Rover, work together to get back to Earth. \n\u2022 It's not rocket science: Kids help Putt-Putt\u00ae and Rover move along and make choices with simple touch controls. Kids' problem-solving skills are sharpened as they discover how their decisions affect what happens to the world around them. \n\u2022 Fun City: You never know what you'll unearth when you tap a moon crater, a doorway or a lunar gas tank. Aliens pop up, music starts, things explode - all the stuff kids love. With so much fun going on, they learn not to overlook a thing! \n\u2022 Putt-Putt\u00ae blasts kids off to a helpful new world: Kids learn math by counting moon crystals and learn how repeating music patterns can help them open a secret gate.\n\nThis Product and Humongous Entertainment are not in any manner affiliated with Putt-Putt, LLC.
